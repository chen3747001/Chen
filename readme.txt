因为virtual box有问题，便用cygwin来写
运行方式：
	assignment1：
		1）打开cygwin指向对应目录
		2）通过 g++ server3.cpp -o server3 || g++ client3.cpp -o client3 来编译文件为exe
		3）通过 ./server3 || ./client3 127.0.0.1 来运行exe

	assignment2:
		
		1）打开cygwin指向对应目录
		2）通过 g++ server.cpp -o server || g++ client.cpp -o client 来编译文件为exe
		3）通过 ./server || ./client 来运行exe	

Because the Virtual Box has a problem, it is written in Cygwin
Operation mode:
	Assignment1:
		1) Open Cygwin and point to the corresponding directory
		2) compile file exe with g++ server3. cpp-o server3 || g++ client3. cpp-o client3
		3) run exe through./server3 | |.. /client3 127.0.0.1

	Assignment2:
		1) Open Cygwin and point to the corresponding directory
		2) compile the file as exe through g++ server. cpp-o server || g++ client. cpp-o client
		3) run exe through./server | |./ client
